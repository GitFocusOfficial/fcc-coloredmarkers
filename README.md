# Learn CSS Colors by Building Colored Markers

Selecting the correct colors for your webpage can greatly improve the aesthetic appeal to your readers.

In this course, you'll build a set of colored markers. You'll learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.

**Step 1**

As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.

Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang attribute with en as its value.

**Step 2**

Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element.
